# Leather products shop! 

This is a react native app that I built for my Hybrid development with Javascript course project. 
This app is an e-commerce app with the capability to hold many products and all the layout and data structure has been built around this focus. 
This app will have a filter, search, and shopping cart functionality (which includes adding and removing items from the cart).
All the above-listed functionalities have not been implemented yet.
